# Decision Framework

Everything you need to compare options and work out which is best for you.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `npm i`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
